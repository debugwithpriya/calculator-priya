# Calculator_priya
A simple Java-based calculator application demonstrating method overloading, user interaction via console, and basic arithmetic operations. Project includes integer and decimal calculations with a menu-driven interface for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This code showcases fundamental OOP'S concepts in Java.

# Java Calculator Application

A simple Java-based calculator application demonstrating **method overloading**, **console-based user interaction**, and **basic arithmetic operations** using object-oriented programming principles.

## Features

- Supports both **integer** and **decimal** numbers
- Performs:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Console-based, **menu-driven interface**
- Demonstrates **method overloading**
- Basic error handling (e.g., division by zero)

##  Project Structure
com.el.task1
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Calculator.java // Contains arithmetic methods (overloaded)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Test.java // Contains main method and user interaction


## üß† Concepts Used

- Method Overloading
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Control Structures (if, switch)
- User Input using `Scanner`
- Error Handling (division by zero)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java installed** on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
4. Compile the files:
   ```bash
